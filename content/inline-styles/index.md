Normal text next to ~subscript text~ for scale, Normal text next to ~subscript with **bold inside** and ***bolditalic*** and *italic* and ~~***bolditalic strikethrough***~~ and ~~strikethrough~~~ for scale

Time to test ^superscript text^ and also test ^formatting ~~***inside the***~~ superscript^, 2^14^ karma gets you in the arcanum.

Testing \*escaped asterisks\*, \_escaped underscores\_, \`escaped _**code**_ span\`, \~escaped tilde\~, \^escaped carets\^

- *Italic with **bold inside***
- ***Bolditalic only with triple asterisks***
- **_This should become bolditalic_**
- _**So should this**_
